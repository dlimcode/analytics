## Project Architecture

### Component Structure

The dashboard follows a modular component-based architecture organized into logical categories:

#### Core Components

- **MainDashboard:** The entry point component that orchestrates the entire dashboard.
- **Dashboard:** A layout component that provides the overall structure.
- **Grid & GridItem:** Flexible grid layout system for responsive dashboard design.
- **MetricCard:** Displays key metrics with optional trends and charts.

#### Analytics Components

The dashboard is divided into 5 main analytical modules:

1. **OverviewPanel:** Provides a high-level summary of all key metrics.
2. **RecruiterProductivity:** Focuses on individual recruiter activities and performance.
3. **RevenueAnalytics:** Tracks financial performance across clients and industries.
4. **DataInputTracking:** Monitors data quality and input activities.
5. **TeamPerformance:** Compares metrics across different teams.

#### Visualization Components

- **BarChartComponent:** Renders bar charts for comparing categorical data.
- **LineChartComponent:** Displays trends over time.
- **PieChartComponent:** Shows data composition and proportions.
- **StackedBarChartComponent:** Compares multiple categories within segments.
- **MultiLineChartComponent:** Compares multiple trends over time.

#### Data Management

- **DataTable:** Renders tabular data with sorting and pagination capabilities.
- **ExportButton:** Provides functionality to export data in different formats.

#### Filtering System

The filtering system is composed of several interconnected components:

- **GlobalFilterButton:** Entry point for filtering across the entire dashboard.
- **FilterModal:** Modal dialog for selecting different filter criteria.
- **DateRangeSelector:** Calendar-based date range selection.
- **EntitySelector:** Multi-select component for filtering by entity types.
- **MetricsSelector:** Allows selection of which metrics to display.
- **FilterBadges:** Visual representation of active filters with removal capability.

### Data Flow Architecture

The dashboard implements a unidirectional data flow pattern:

1. **State Management:** Each tab (Overview, Recruiter, Revenue, etc.) maintains its own filter state.
2. **Filter Changes:** When filters are updated:
   - Filter state is updated in the parent component (MainDashboard)
   - Changes propagate downward to analytical components
3. **Data Filtering:** Each analytical component applies filters to its data
4. **Visualization Updates:** Charts and tables re-render with filtered data

### Theming System

The dashboard uses a CSS variables-based theming system:

- **Light/Dark Modes:** Full support for light and dark color schemes.
- **Color Tokens:** Semantic color variables for consistent UI.
- **Component Styling:** Consistent styling across all UI components.

## UI Components Library

The dashboard leverages a comprehensive UI component library built with:

- **RadixUI:** For accessible and customizable UI primitives
- **Tailwind CSS:** For utility-based styling
- **Recharts:** For interactive data visualizations

Key UI components include:

- **Button:** Various button styles and variants
- **Dialog:** Modal dialogs for actions and detailed views
- **Tabs:** For switching between different dashboard sections
- **Popover:** For tooltips and contextual information
- **Calendar:** For date selection
- **Table:** For tabular data display
- **Badge:** For status indicators and filter tags
- **Card:** For containing related information
- **Dropdown:** For selection inputs
- **Form inputs:** Text inputs, checkboxes, etc.

## Filter System Deep Dive

### Filter Types

The dashboard supports multiple filter types:

1. **Date Filters:** 
   - Custom date ranges with calendar selection
   - Predefined ranges (Last Week, Last Month, Last Quarter, YTD)

2. **Entity Filters:**
   - Recruiters: Filter by individual recruiters
   - Clients: Filter by specific clients
   - Industries: Filter by industry sectors
   - Teams: Filter by team groups

3. **Metric Filters:**
   - Control which metrics are displayed in each dashboard
   - Show/hide specific data points

### Filter Persistence

- Filters are maintained separately for each dashboard tab
- When switching tabs, the appropriate filters for that context are applied
- The filter state is preserved during navigation

### Filter UI Components

- **FilterModal:** Main interface for setting all filter criteria
- **DateRangeSelector:** Calendar interface with presets
- **EntitySelector:** Searchable multi-select with checkboxes
- **MetricsSelector:** Toggle switches for metric visibility
- **FilterBadges:** Visual display of active filters

## Data Export Features

The dashboard provides robust data export capabilities:

- **CSV Export:** Structured data in comma-separated format
- **Excel Export:** For more complex formatting and analysis
- **PDF Export:** For reporting and sharing

The ExportButton component handles these exports, with appropriate formatting for each export type.

## Performance Optimization

The dashboard implements several techniques to ensure optimal performance:

- **Memoization:** `useMemo` and `useCallback` to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- **Virtualization:** Efficient rendering of large datasets
- **Code Splitting:** Lazy loading components as needed
- **Optimized Charts:** Performant chart rendering with appropriate animations

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Charts Not Rendering Correctly

**Issue:** Charts appear blank or incorrectly sized.

**Solution:**
- Ensure container has a defined height
- Check that data format matches chart requirements
- Verify that required props are correctly passed
- For responsive issues, check if parent containers have proper sizing

#### Filter Not Applying to Data

**Issue:** Setting filters doesn't update the visualizations.

**Solution:**
- Check filter state in browser console
- Verify filter callback functions are correctly passed down component tree
- Ensure filter logic in data filtering functions is correct
- Confirm that filtered data is correctly passed to visualization components

#### Date Filter Selecting Wrong Range

**Issue:** Date range filtering is not working as expected.

**Solution:**
- Check date format consistency (all dates should use the same format)
- Verify start and end dates are correctly passed
- Ensure date comparison logic handles time zones properly
- For "Last X days/months" presets, verify calculation logic

#### Export Functionality Issues

**Issue:** Data exports missing data or formatting incorrectly.

**Solution:**
- Verify export data is correctly formatted
- Check for any transformations needed before export
- Ensure export functions are handling async operations correctly
- For large datasets, implement pagination or chunking

#### Slow Dashboard Performance

**Issue:** Dashboard is slow to respond, especially with large datasets.

**Solution:**
- Implement pagination and limit initial data load
- Add memoization for expensive calculations
- Optimize chart rendering (reduce animations, simplify data)
- Consider server-side filtering for very large datasets

### Browser Compatibility

The dashboard is optimized for modern browsers:
- Chrome 80+
- Firefox 75+
- Safari 13+
- Edge 80+

For older browsers, consider polyfills for:
- ES6+ features
- CSS Variables
- Flexbox/Grid layout

### Mobile Responsiveness Issues

When encountering display issues on mobile devices:

- Check viewport settings
- Verify grid breakpoints are correctly configured
- Ensure charts have minimum heights to prevent collapse
- Test filter modals on small screens for usability

## Advanced Customization

### Adding New Metrics

To add new metrics to the dashboard:

1. Add the metric to the data model
2. Create visualization components if needed
3. Update filter options to include the new metric
4. Add the metric to relevant analytical components

### Creating Custom Charts

To implement custom visualizations:

1. Create a new chart component following existing patterns
2. Implement Recharts components with appropriate props
3. Add data transformation functions
4. Integrate with MetricCard or standalone container

### Extending Filter Capabilities

To add new filter types:

1. Update the FilterModal component to include the new filter
2. Create a selector component for the filter if needed
3. Modify filter state structure in MainDashboard
4. Update filter application logic in analytical components

## Development Best Practices

When extending the dashboard:

- Follow existing component patterns
- Maintain unidirectional data flow
- Keep components focused on single responsibilities
- Document props and key functions
- Implement proper error handling
